Starters By Game had all 3 starter profiles for each of the 5 games so all 3 fire red starters and so on for each game 


The Gen 2 starters from when you beat the game RSE and you finished the NATDEX have cheats on by default and are in its own folder.

All 5 games now have a save file standing near the Safari Zone counter, text set to fast and battle scene set to off as well . Drop the profiles in your profile folder run the bot load them and  go talk to the NPC for the Safari Zone (For Testing Purposes)

Made Saves States Test Profiles each game has 3 save states saved in the Safari Zone, spinning on the first route with all mons on the block list and standing near water with fishing rod set to start fishing 
These were made for quick and easy testing when a new feature comes out to make sure all other features have retained their operational status
